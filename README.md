# Abstract Factory Pattern

- it is one of the creational patterns.
- it is considered as a layer of abstraction over a factory pattern.
- it works around a super-factory which creates other factories.
- provides us with a framework that allwos us to create objects that follow a general pattern.So at runtime, the abtract factory is coupled with any desired concrete factory which can create objects of the desired type.
